# hello-world
### Brief greetings to the interweb gits

I have some programming experience, encountering some in my coursework.
Now I wish to explore the subject on its own more deeply. I am approaching
this as a hobby (albeit a professionally advantageous one).

I wish to utilize GitHub as a platform for learning how to program like a developer,
complete with version control and production testing. This will also serve as a
playground for me to learn new languages and try my hand at developing software.

Particularly interesting things I'd like to do are learning and applying concepts
in data science and machine learning, web development, and game development.
Perhaps when I get more comfortable with these skill-sets, I intend to engage some
open projects that may be willing to tolerate another insufferable git collaborator.

Thank you,
